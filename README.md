# Node JS bot for challenges
To create a web-client challenge, we have to code a bot which simulate admin actions (e.g clicking on link) every 2 minutes.
I found differents ways, we can do this with CRON or with an infinite loop with a timeout.
You can find in this repo the code for sqlite3 and mysql DBMS.

## Libraries:
To simulate a bot we can use puppeteer:

And to interact with database:

<li>https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql</li>
